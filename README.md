Graceful degredation and service workers are related in the sense that they are additional components that are added after the bare minimum funcitonality is introduced. For example, when creating a website, it is important to have components which exist assuming the maximum technology is available. From there, you can then add more functionalities to lower levels. This can mean adding service workers which help store the results of jobs so they don't have to be redone everytime a call is done. Similarly this can mean adding graceful degredation which makes sure past versions of software and libraries can still operate everything necessary for the application. Both of them would occur after the initial steps of development, but are still essential to software engineering.
